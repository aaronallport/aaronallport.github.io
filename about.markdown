Hi! I'm Aaron Allport, a Quote-to-Cash specialist with a background in Salesforce, Technical Architecture, and CRM. I lead the Salesforce Quote-to-Cash practice for Slalom across the UK and Ireland.

This is my personal website, where I blog about various technical topics. In the past these have focussed on JavaScript and web development, however since 2015 have shifted in nature towards Salesforce-inspired items.

All views presented on this website are my own.
