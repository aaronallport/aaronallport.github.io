It's that time of year where one generally writes down what they aim to do (with the best intentions of course) over the next year. For me, my resolutions for 2013 are as follows:
<ul>
	<li>Write at least one technical blog post each week (no doubt in among the usual rambling)</li>
	<li>Speak to family more often, at least weekly (that must make me sound terrible, but I'm talking grand-parents and some of the more non-immediate family members)</li>
	<li>Make this site pretty (looking bland as I write this)</li>
	<li>Spend more time at home to watch my beautiful daughter grow</li>
	<li>Set a wedding date/book the wedding</li>
	<li>Play more Xbox 360 online (more for the friends/social aspect of it)</li>
	<li>Replace the iMac (probably with another iMac, but haven't decided just yet)</li>
</ul>
That's me covered for now. Here's to seeing these through over the course of this year!
