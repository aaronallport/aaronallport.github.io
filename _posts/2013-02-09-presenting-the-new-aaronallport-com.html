After a few weeks of development, I present the new <a title="Aaron Allport | A freelance web developer form Colchester, UK" href="http://aaronallport.com">aaronallport.com</a>

Developed as a mobile-first, responsive <a title="WordPress" href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</a> theme, I have tried to put more on an emphasis on content, deliberately opting for a stripped-back, useable look. The end result means few menu items, and less clicks to get to each part of the site.

I've been able to use <a title="SASS - Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets" href="http://sass-lang.com" target="_blank">SASS</a> in anger, along with coding native JavaScript again (no jQuery to be found here). This has been awesome as the JavaScript is actually the smallest site artefact to load!

I intend on putting the theme (with a basic SCSS and JavaScript library on top) up on <a title="Aaron Allport on GitHub" href="https://github.com/aaronallport" target="_blank">GitHub</a> in order to give back to the community a little. More on that in a couple of weeks.

If there any teething issues found with the site then please <a title="E-mail Aaron Allport" href="mailto://aaron@aaronallport.com" target="_blank">drop me an email</a> or send me a message on <a title="Aaron Allport on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/aaronallport" target="_blank">twitter</a>.
