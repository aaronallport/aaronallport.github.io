I'm due to be a father imminently. Naturally, that makes one take a step back and look at life's wider perspective. Looking at factors such as my job, work/life balance, seeing if I'm doing the things that not only make me happy, but more importantly empower me to pass that happiness on to my family's new addition.

I love web design. I love the research into how businesses and customers view and use web sites. I love architecting solutions. Being a programmer at heart, I love producing beautiful-looking, performant HTML and CSS. I love producing beautiful back-end code, which in turn has an impact on that beautiful HTML and CSS. I love bringing it all together. MostÂ importantly, I love the smile that is brought to the faces of those using something I have simply loved producing.

I'm not allowed to divulge much of what I do for a living. That's because I don't work for myself and the company I work for (as you'd rightfully expect) respects client confidentiality and expect its employees to do the same. Those that know me well know who I work for. They probably understand my frustration at times with the slow-moving pace when it comes to embracing modern web development techniques, twinned with the latest and greatest HTML and CSS.

This has to change. With the ever expanding devices market where the notion of "one size fits all" was dead and buried a long time ago, the use of up-to-date HTML and CSS to ensure that a web site will work on every type of device is paramount. It's something I'm trying to change where I work. Luckily, I'm in a position where I'm working directly with one of my web hero's.

I am however in awe of being able to work for yourself and advocate how things should be done. It's got me thinking...
