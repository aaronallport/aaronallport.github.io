## Familiar territory

The 4th of November 2017 marked the day I boarded a plane and flew to San Francisco ([Virgin Atlantic](https://www.virginatlantic.com/), as per usual the service was superb). A month later in the year compared to last year, [Dreamforce 2017](https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/) promised to offer more product announcements and innovation than last year. I was fortunate enough to get a day to experience a little tourism (which took me on a cycle ride to [Sausalito](http://www.sausalito.gov/) for a pizza and beer at [Bar Bocce](http://www.barbocce.com/)) before settling into the conference proper for the week.

## The fourth industrial revolution

Also known as the Marc Benioff keynote, a range of topics were discussed, including new product announcements.

Marc explained how we're in the midst of the fourth industrial revolution, and that we live in an age of nano-technology, Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, 3D Printing and the like. These technologies are revolutionising the way we live our lives, and as a result we should be harnessing these technologies for the greater good of our customers to deliver the connected, personalised experience that they expect.

Marc also put a huge emphasis on Diversity, Inclusion, Equality, and Recognition. It was nice to see Salesforce using their industry might to shout the message of these important equality topics. Salesforce also announced equality in the environment, announcing that their cloud is a [net-zero cloud](https://www.environmentalleader.com/2017/04/salesforce-achieves-net-zero-emissions-improves-greenpeace-standings/).

[Salesforce have announced a strategic partnership with Google](https://www.salesforce.com/company/news-press/press-releases/2017/11/171106-5.jsp) to integrate Salesforce and G Suite and also have Salesforce running on the Google Cloud Platform as a preferred cloud vendor of Salesforce going forward.

### My, my, my...

Salesforce announced the following major products during the main keynote:

#### myTrailhead

Quip now supports [live-updating apps](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2017/11/introducing-quip-collaboration-platform.html) such as calendars and Kanban boards to drive productivity on the Quip platform.

## Success cloud

Less of a cloud and more of a portfolio of adoption support and advisory services, [Salesforce Success Cloud](https://salesforce.com/successcloud) is designed to put a "package" around the support and readiness services Salesforce provide around consultants, experts, specialists, and tools to set organisations and partners up with personalised advice and best practices from Salesforce.

## Heroku

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) was given more prominence this year than in previous years, underlining the commitment to this platform from Salesforce. The large Trailhead area in Moscone West had an entire section carved out for Heroku demonstrations (which included some free Heroku credits as giveaways).

### Heroku Shield

[Heroku Shield](https://blog.heroku.com/announcing-heroku-shield) was demonstrated at one of the booths in the Trailhead area. Essentially, Heroku Shield facilitates regulatory compliance for things such as [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html) and [GDPR](http://www.eugdpr.org/). Start with a new Private Space and simply enabling the "Shield" setting in the Heroku Spaces configuration page.

## Force.com is now the Lightning platform

At the Salesforce Platform keynote, the Force.com platform is now being re-branded as the [Lightning platform](https://www.salesforce.com/uk/products/platform/lightning/), signalling the intent from Salesforce to push Lightning technologies going forward given the headway that has been made over the last few releases towards implementing Lightning functionality.

## Until next year!

Dreamforce 2017 was a blast! I'm feeling excited about the new features of Einstein, IoT and Heroku in particular - so much so I'm hacking away on an idea already!
