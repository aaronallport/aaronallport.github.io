When working on a responsive design, the ability to test on as many hardware platforms (am I'm talking real hardware, not emulators) is critical. There are so many <a title="Seven - Stuff and Nonsense Blog" href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/seven" target="_blank">subtle quirks</a> in the sheer amount of available screen resolutions, platforms, and browser support for emerging technologies. Adobe released Shadow, or rather <a title="Adobe Edge Inspect" href="http://html.adobe.com/edge/inspect/" target="_blank">Adobe Edge Inspect</a> a while ago, and it has been factored into the <a title="Adobe Creative Cloud" href="http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/creativecloud.html" target="_blank">Creative Cloud</a> offering. Trouble is, the last time I used it, it was only supporting iOS and Android. Enter <a title="Remote Preview" href="http://viljamis.com/blog/2012/remote-preview/" target="_blank">Remote Preview</a>

Don't get me wrong, Remote Preview isn't without the odd bug or two, but it sure looks promising as a low-cost, low-effort way to get a device lab up and running.

I'll be testing this myself soon, but if anyone has in the meantime, please feel free to share your experiences.
