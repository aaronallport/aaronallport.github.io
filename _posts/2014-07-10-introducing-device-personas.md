## TL;DR

The device market is enormous, and forever growing. Where one device category seamlessly falls into
another, we as web designers and developers need embrace this fact and make some sensible decisions
on the types of device that will roughly reflect the experience we'll ultimately deliver to the user.

Often, higher-ups and non-technical folk struggle with the notion that responsive design isn't just
about "making it fit". That is to say that they don't believe (or most likely, know) that the screen is
but one feature of a device. GPS, ambient light sensor, orientation, accelerometer, compass - these
are all device features. Being able to translate this effectively means that whilst a great deal goes
in to the presentation, additional focus is put on those extra device features. When combined with a
feature support matrix, one can use these as a base-line feature of an offering, or as an enhancement
to the user experience.

## TODO: There are too many devices available on the market

## TODO: Edge-less web

## TODO: Business problem (folks are fixated on screen size)

## TODO: Everything is a feature (and that includes the type of and size of display)

## TODO: Device personas - documenting the features offered by intelligent "slices" of the fragmented device market (re-think this title)

## TODO: Device personas - something to design for

## TODO: Device personas - something to develop for

## TODO: The feature support matrix

## TODO: Device personas - something to test for (metion the device lab)
