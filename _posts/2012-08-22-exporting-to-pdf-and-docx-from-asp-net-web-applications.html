As part of a personal web project I'm working on, I require the ability to export to PDF format. I've found a library which offers the ability to do this easily, and I thought I'd spread the love and share it, along with a link on an example of using it.

For PDF exporting, I present <a title="iTextSharp on SourceForge" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/itextsharp/" target="_blank">iTextSharp</a>.

<a title="Creating PDF Documents in ASP.NET" href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/20640/Creating-PDF-Documents-in-ASP-NET" target="_blank">Here's a link on how to use</a>.

Enjoy!!
