These days with an ever-expanding repotoire being necessary to deal with the constantly changing web standards, differing performance factors being necessary to ensure users on mobile devices and responsive design now a necessity, the ability to automate has become a matter of importance. Being a web developer, I think in terms of how I can automate each part of my workflow. I look at project set up, the development stage and production optimisation. Being a hacker of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, JavaScript and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> by trade, I look to exploit these technologies where possible to automate. I'll explain what I use to automate my workflow to make my productivity increase where possible.
<h2 class="h2">Why write this post in the first place?</h2>
Reading <a title="Front End Ops - Smashing Magazine" href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/06/11/front-end-ops/" target="_blank">a fantastic post on the role of the front ops engineer</a>, I thoug I'd jot down my thoughts on the practical application on many of the concepts discussed in that article. Also, I can be a lazy bastard when it comes to repitition in day-to-day work. If I can cobble something together in an hour that saves me 10 minutes of time each time I use it, then anything over 6 uses of that widget/script/whatever that I've put together is time saved.
<h2 class="h2">Development tools</h2>
I use a few select tools when developing web applications. First and foremost is the code editor. Any web developer worth their salt will use something that includes syntax highlighting, auto-indentation and code completion/suggestions. Snippets support and the ability to plug in additional features are a must these days. I personally use <a title="Sublime Text" href="http://sublimetext.com" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a> as my code editor of choice, with syntax support for SASS turned on by installing the package at <a title="SASS Sublime Text Bundle" href="https://github.com/nathos/sass-textmate-bundle" target="_blank">https://github.com/nathos/sass-textmate-bundle</a>

I also have the <a title="Emmet" href="http://emmet.io" target="_blank">emmet</a> plugin installed, which allows me to type HTML markup as if it were a CSS selector and have that markup expanded to be its HTML representation with a simple Ctrl+e on the keyboard (regardless of the operating system you choose to use).

Next up, I use <a title="Hammer for Mac" href="http://hammerformac.com" target="_blank">Hammer for Mac</a>, a tool that can automatically compile <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and JavaScript from <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> partials, <abbr title="Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets">SASS</abbr> and CofeeScript. This saves me having to fire up <abbr title="Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets">SASS</abbr> watch on the command line, and I can also use variables in my <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, as well as <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> includes to allow me to re-use snippets of <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> for things such as menu's and the <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> element contents. It also watches for changes to anything in your project, allowing open browsers to re-load to reflect your updated changes. Smart paths mean I never have to remember where on the file system a resource lives, such as an image.

Perhaps most importantly, I have a web browser open for which I do my primary development in. I use <a title="Chrome Canary" href="https://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/chrome/browser/canary.html" target="_blank">Chrome Canary</a>, which allows me to test using the bleeding edge version of one of the fastest web browsers in existence. It also has any improvements roughly 11 weeks before the release version, meaning I can test new or experimental techniques as the support comes along for them. Also, Chrome Canary is updated nightly. I then move on to <a title="Firefox Nightly" href="http://nightly.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">Firefox Nightly</a>, <a title="Opera Next" href="http://www.opera.com/developer/next" target="_blank">Opera Next</a>, and then <a title="Safari - Apple" href="https://www.apple.com/uk/safari/" target="_blank">Safari</a>, <a title="Google Chrome" href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/" target="_blank">Chrome (release version)</a>, <a title="Firefox" href="http://getfirefox.com" target="_blank">Firefox</a> and <a title="Opera Browser" href="http://opera.com" target="_blank">Opera</a>. I use a Mac, so I run <a title="VMWare Fusion" href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/overview.html" target="_blank">VMWare Fusion</a> to virtualise <a title="Internet Explorer" href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/internet-explorer/download-ie" target="_blank">Internet Explorer</a>, using the virtual machines available from <a title="modern.ie" href="http://modern.ie" target="_blank">modern.ie</a>

For rapid prototyping, I employ <a title="Ghostlab" href="http://vanamco.com/ghostlab" target="_blank">Ghostlab</a>, which facilitates synchronous, real-time testing across devices. With minimal set-up I can have all devices I own connected on the same network as my development machine in sync with anything I do in my web browser. This includes form field completion, form submission, scrolling and just about everything else.
<h2 class="h2">Project set-up</h2>
Frameworks are today's norm. I don't personally see the point in crafting <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> (via <abbr title="Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets">SASS</abbr> or LESS if you use those) for a button or heading/paragraph styles when frameworks offer the ability to do so or a custom code snippet you've saved gets re-used thousands of times. I naturally have an affiliation with a framework called <a title="Rock Hammer on GitHub" href="https://github.com/malarkey/Rock-Hammer" target="_blank">Rock Hammer</a> (because I helped to build it and continue to actively maintain it). It has been designed from the outset to work with <a title="Hammer for Mac" href="http://hammerformac.com" target="_blank">Hammer for Mac</a>. Using <a title="Rock Hammer on GitHub" href="https://github.com/malarkey/Rock-Hammer" target="_blank">Rock Hammer</a> gives me a consistent base to being every project from.
<h2 class="h2">Project development</h2>
When developing a project, I simply have my code editor open with Hammer for Mac happily whirring away in the background, along with <a title="Grunt" href="http://gruntjs.com" target="_blank">Grunt</a> (explained below) for automating production optimisations, right from the off. This, means I'm testing on production-targeted code from the outset. My web browser is constantly open, being automatically refreshed using the <a title="Grunt Live Reload Plugin" href="https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-contrib-livereload" target="_blank">Grunt live reload plugin</a> so I'm able to pick up and see changes instantly.
<h2 class="h2">Production optimisation</h2>
Whilst Hammer for Mac offers minification out of the box now, it names the minified <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and JavaScript files with the value of the outputted file MD5 hash. Whilst this allows any browser reloads to constantly pick up the latest changes, it's not exactly production friendly. I therefore do not use Hammer for Mac's optimisation features. I use an automation tool called <a title="Grunt" href="http://gruntjs.com" target="_blank">Grunt</a>. Put simply, Grunt is written in JavaScript, is configured in JavaScript, and has a very simple job: Automate tasks. Grunt has more plugins than I can remember, but it can be up and running from install to minifying <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and JavaScript, linting <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and JavaScript, compressing images, generating sprites, unit testing JavaScript, concatenating files together and even compiling <abbr title="Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets">SASS</abbr> and CoffeeScript in a matter of minutes. I cannot recommend Grunt highly enough to those looking to automate tasks in a language every web developer worth their salt should find second nature. Grunt runs as a <a title="node.js" href="http://nodejs.org" target="_blank">node.js</a> plugin, so it is available for all operating systems. All grunt plugins are installed via "npm install" commands, so a little command-line exposure is necessary I'm afraid. Trust me, the gains to be made here are staggering given the relatively little effort required to get Grunt up and running. There is a handy "<a title="Grunt Watch plugin" href="https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-contrib-watch" target="_blank">watch</a>" plug-in available for Grunt too, so every time a bunch of files (specified by patterns you choose) are updated, Grunt can run a defined set of tasks. I point the configuration of this to my "Build" folder produced by Hammer for Mac.
<h2 class="h2">Graceful fall-backs</h2>
Regardless of the fact that it is used in Rock Hammer, I'd use <a title="Selectivizr" href="http://selectivizr.com/" target="_blank">Selectivizr</a> to provide CSS3 support to the less capable Internet Explorer browsers. Granted, it sits on top of a JavaScript library such as <a title="jQuery" href="http://jquery.com" target="_blank">jQuery</a> but using conditional comments we can ensure that only older Internet Explorer browsers get this anyway. I'm also a big fan of <a title="Modernizr" href="http://modernizr.com" target="_blank">Modernizr</a> and <a title="Respond.js on GitHub" href="https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond" target="_blank">Respond.js</a> which provide feature detection and Internet Explorer Media Query support for versions 8 and below.
<h2 class="h2">Monitoring</h2>
Monitoring is one area that could do with some love. I'm yet to find a suitable dashboard solution, so I'm in the process of writing one. Watch this space and of course an up-coming blog post for more on this!
<h2 class="h2">Finally</h2>
Whilst this list can no doubt be added to over time, this hopefully gives a little insight into what I use to apply the principles explained in the <a title="Front End Ops on Smashing Magazine" href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/06/11/front-end-ops/" target="_blank">Front-End Ops article</a>.
