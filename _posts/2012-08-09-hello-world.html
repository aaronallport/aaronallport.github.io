As you may have guessed from the title, I've decided to turn my personal site back into a blog, where I intend to write lots about the technologies and development techniques that I work with. I suppose "Hello World" is quite the fitting title, giving my recent lack of online "noise". I'll be posting more entries going forward and customising this site out in the open, documenting my experiences as I go. Here's to that!
