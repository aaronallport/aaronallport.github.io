Following my recent re-ignition of my blog (which is powered by <a title="Wordpress.org" href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">Wordpress</a>), I began the hunt for a theme on which to build my site design. I've been a massive fan of the <a title="Twitter Bootstrap" href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a> framework for some time now, given its time saving styles written in <a title="LESS CSS" href="http://lesscss.org/" target="_blank">LESS</a>. The fact that <a title="Wikipedia article on responsive web design" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_Web_Design" target="_blank">responsive design</a> is thrown in the mix makes it very attractive as a framework on which to start new web projects. I have found myself using it on several web projects recently. I contemplated writing my own Wordpress template based on Bootstrap, but a quick search on Google revealed the theme that this site is currently using, called <a title="Alienship Wordpress theme, by John Parris" href="http://www.johnparris.com/alienship/" target="_blank">Alienship</a>.

Since uploading the Alienship theme and switching to it in Wordpress, I've since changed the default <a title="Wordpress TwentyEleven theme" href="http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/twentyeleven/" target="_blank">TwentyEleven</a> theme header images (which are carried over to Alienship) with some photos taken by my fiancee. With a Bootstrap-based theme on which to build my own design, I am now able to crack on with getting a design finalised whilst I continue to add blog posts.

Thanks for stopping by.
