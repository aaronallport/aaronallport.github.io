Recently, a problem cropped up at work where I had to allow sortable list components to be dragged from one list to another using jQuery. The requirement was to have one list item cloned from a source list and inserted into a destination list, where an item in the destination list could in fact be a sub-list. I thought I'd post how to achieve this using just sortables in jQuery (no draggables going on here!)
