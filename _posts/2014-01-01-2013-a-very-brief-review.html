As each year draws to a close, I'm often contemplating new years resolutions for the next, which end up as fireworks of ideas going exploding in my mind, which seems fitting given the fan-fare of the fireworks that are used to bring in each year. Coming up with resolutions for the next year often cause one to be reflective of how the past year has gone.

2013 was the year in which me and my fiancee purchased out first home together, and moved our family in. We found out that Isla, our daughter, was to be graced with a brother or sister on the 29th of December. This day has passed, and now baby Allport will definitely be meeting us in January of 2014. Isla turned one in 2013, which goes to show just how quickly time passes. I guess that was the main motivation for my resolutions, which I'll jot down when I've come up with a manageable list I'm happy with!

A brief timeline of my year:
<ul>
	<li>January: I got a new job, working with web technologies I love and being given the freedom to explore new ideas. I'm respected by my peers and I'm responsible for setting technical direction.</li>
	<li>March: Me and Bec have been together for 2 years.</li>
	<li>April: We discovered we were expecting again.</li>
	<li>August: I turned 29.</li>
	<li>November: We purchased our first home together.</li>
</ul>
I wish everyone a happy new year, and hope that 2014 brings you success.
