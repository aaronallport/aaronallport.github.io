<h1 class="h2">About Me</h1>
Having worked with the web for a number of years, I am well versed in modern standards and development techniques. With the multitude of devices available to consumers these days, it is important that web sites and web applications not only look great on the desktop, but also on mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets. The term "responsive design" can be heard a lot these days. To me, it is something that should be incorporated into a project regardless. Therefore I always created responsive design into any and every project I undertake.
