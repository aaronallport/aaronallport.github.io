			<h1 class="h2">Web Development</h1>
			<p>Having worked with the web for a number of years, I am well versed in modern web standards and development techniques. With the multitude of devices available to consumers these days, it is important that web sites and web applications not only look great on the desktop, but also on mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets.</p>
			<h2 class="h2">What you can expect</h2>
			<p>Intentionally working with one client at a time, you can expect full dedication to your project when we are working together. I am friendly, professional, and am always able to answer any queries within 24 hours.</p>
			<h2 class="h2">Typical schedule when working with you</h2>
			<p>When working with clients, there are several phases that simply MUST be done in order to ensure the best possible outcome.</p>
			<p>I do not undertake projects where I am unable to:</p>
			<ul class="bullet-list bullet-list-black">
				<li>Perform research on your business, what you do, who your customers are, how they currently view your brand, etc</li>
				<li>Plan to your budget. I do not undertake fixed-price contracts. Therefore, we will plan according to your needs and budget to ensure that my time is spent in the most cost-efficient manner for you.</li>
				<li>Plan for testing. Testing is crucial in these days of multiple devices which are web-enabled (smart phones, tablets, TV's, even a top-end fridge).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Project delivery usually happens in two week "sprints" (this is a term borrowed from a software delivery method called "Agile"). A sprint is essentially a work period, using a pre-agreed list of newly-defined requirements, change requests and bug fixes as the things to do during that period. Basically, we will agree what we I am doing for you in each two week period, using the list of outstanding requests, changes and bugs as a starting point. I have a finite amaount of time in a two week period, and each item on the outstanding work list has a time estimate against it. We will work together to use my time for the most benefit to both of us in getting your project delivered. We will together prioritise certain items as part of this process. I will use any issue tracking tool you may have set up already, or provide you acces to my own if not. This way, we both have complete visability of how things are going, knowing what needs to be done because we worked together to plan out the current word period.</p>
			<p>At the end of the two week period, you will receive a set of artefacts that we've agreed upon. These can be research write-ups, screen designs, prototypes or even the finished product. As each two week period completes, these artefacts are essentially built upon (using the result of the last two week period as our starting point). This form of "iterative" development is designed to give you a working product, built to agreed functionality and specification, that is built up over time.</p>
			<p>This form of delivery is known as "Agile" development. Given I work to two week sprints, you will only ever pay for two weeks of my time at once. Of course, the length of each sprint can be negotiated, but based on my past experience, two weeks generally works best.</p>
			<h2 class="h2">Contract and NDA</h2>
			<p>There will be a contract (I'd be a fool not to have one these days), but it is written in plain English and is easy to understand. There is nothing out of the ordinary in it, and I'd be happy to talk you through it. As for a Non-Disclosure Agreement, I'd be happy to sign one. I do have an NDA I like to use to that protects my interests as well as yours, but we can get to that when we begein working together.</p>
			<h2 class="h2">What I do not do</h2>
			<p>There are things that I am unable to offer, and these are explained below. Note that I do have a great list of contacts, so I am generally able to recommend someone who can do a sterling job on any of the below items, should you require that service too.</p>
			<ul class="bullet-list bullet-list-black">
				<li>I am not a hosting provider, and therefore cannot manage the day-to-day hosting of your web site. I can recommend decent hosting providers if you need one. I am however more than happy to work with you to get your new design live on your hosting platform if needed.</li>
				<li>Technical support for the running your web site is not included (although I can always point you in the direction of a trusted partner). If you would like updates or changes making to your site that require my services, we can arrange that seperately.</li>
				<li>Back-end code support/de-bugging is not my area of expertise, but I can recommend great people who can help you based on the technologies you use.</li>
			</ul>
