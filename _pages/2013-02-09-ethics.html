			<h1 class="h2">Ethics</h1>
			<p>Everyone has rules that they work to, and I am no exception. There are certain projects types that I do not work on simply because I do not agree with what they represent. These include:</p>
			<ul class="bullet-list">
				<li>Anything to do with pro-weapons or armament</li>
				<li>Anything that uses public money for private gain</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="h2">It isn't all doom and gloom...</h2>
			<p>Now that we've got the "won't do's" out of my system, I would like to draw attention to something I do care about, and in-fitting with the ethics that I work to. I set aside a couple of pro-bono days each month for charity and other non-profit work. If you are a charity or non-profit organisation and would like to work with me, then please <a href="mailto:aaron@aaronallport.com">send me an email</a>.</p>
